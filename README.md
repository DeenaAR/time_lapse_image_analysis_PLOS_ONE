# time_lapse_image_analysis_PLOS_ONE
This repository is a collection of MATLAB scripts and CellProfiler pipelines described in detail in our protocol 
on protocols.io:

(publication pending)

They were written by Deena Rennerfeldt (@deenaar), Matt Whitfield (@whitkala), and Pristinavae Manning (as 
an undergraduate under the supervision of Deena Rennerfeldt) as part of a time lapse image analysis research
study:

(publication pending)

These scripts are available as an effort toward providing reproducability for that research study rather than as
a turnkey analysis program.  The data files generated by CellProfiler for that study are also provided, where
each file represents a set of time lapse images for a single colony tracked at the single-cell level (using 
the CellProfiler pipeline listed as D9 in this repository).
